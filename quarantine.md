# Quarantine

4/28/20

I thought I'd write a topical piece on the quarantine, cause why not I have nothing better to
do. It's affected me in a lot of different ways and has me in some kind of mood.

Technically, I'm still enrolled as a student and yea I'm supposed to be keeping us with classes,
but with the allure of the internet and nothing to keep me trapped in reality, I get sucked into
the infinite void of reading about unrelated things and not diving deep into any one thing in
particular..
