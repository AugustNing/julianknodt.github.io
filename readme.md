# Hi.

Wassup, these are just random thoughts or opinions I have.
Take them seriously at your own risk, y'all would just be listening to a person trying to find
his own way through life.
Thus, chew on these marbles of my thoughts, roll them around in your mouth, and digest them at
your own pace.
If you have any suggestions, go to the [github repo][github repo] for this page, and file an
issue, or make a pull request! I'll get to 'em eventually.

## Projects

- [Ink Renderer](http://ink-renderer.herokuapp.com/)
  - [Github](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/gfx-final-project)
  - Final Project for [graphics](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring20/cos426/)
- [Square Heap](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/sqr_heap)
  - An experiment with modifying the number of children for a heap. See readme for more info
- [Mireba](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/mireba)
  - A photorealistic raytracer based on [Mitsuba](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/). WIP.
- [quick maths](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/quick_maths)
  - A simple math library for use with mireba. Hopefully I can continue to upgrade to be more
    full-fledged for general purpose use but right now it's designed for graphics.
- [Mat-FST](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/mat-fst)
  - An experiment for using [Finite State Transducers](https://github.com/BurntSushi/fst) as
    sparse matrices. Check out the readme for more info.
- [Small-SAT](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/small_sat)
  - A concurrent SAT solver based on MiniSAT. Exploring the idea of having multiple threads, but
    would've been a lot better if I had known Rust better at the time. Still learned a lot from
    it though.
- [artPanel](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/artPanel)
  - A fun CLI util to render images in terminal with color. If you're in terminal all the time
    and find it bland you can run this in the background to lighten things up.

## Games

- [Starmine](https://julianknodt.github.io/starmine.html)
  - A space shooter resource gathering game

## Other Stuff

## Random Questions
Since I spend a good amount of time just thinking about things, I've accumulated a lot of
questions which I haven't really found the answer to. I find them worth spending some time
thinking on, not just for the answer, but for thinking about why I even thought of the question
in the first place.

- Does writing code increase one's knowledge? Or is it merely an application of existing
  knowledge?

- Does knowing about logical fallacies help prevent us from making them?

- Do phones decrease reading comprehension? This could be due to unnecessary information that
  people have now started to ignore such as privacy policies, notifications, or ads.

- Is it more agreeable(however you choose to define "agreeable") to listen to music that matches
  a mood or to listen to music that contradicts it, i.e. listening to blues while sad or pop
  music while happy?

- Assuming that irreversible climate change occurs, then what?
