# Local News Index

I noticed there was not a good site for condensing local news sources from various cities.
I thought I'd compile a small list for fun.


|State |City           |Name                 |Site       |
|---   |---            |---                  |---        |
|CA    |Saratoga       |Saratogian           |[L][SA]    |
|CA    |Los Altos      |Los Altos Town Crier |[L][LO]    |
|CA    |Cupertino      |Cupertino Today      |[L][CP]    |
|CA    |Mountain View  |MV Voice             |[L][MV]    |
|CA    |San Francisco  |SF Chronicle         |[L][SF]    |
|CA    |Palo Alto      |Palo Alto Online     |[L][PA]    |
|CA    |San Jose       |Mercury News         |[L][SJ]    |
